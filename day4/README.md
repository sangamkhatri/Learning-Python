ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ Conditions, String Manipulation & Flowcharts

Todayâ€™s focus was all about improving our Python logic and readability skills. Here's what I practiced and learned:

---

## âœ… What I Covered

- **Conditional Statements**

  - `if`, `elif`, and `else` blocks
  - Nested conditions
  - Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
  - Real-life examples like voting eligibility and account transfers

- **String Manipulation**

  - Accessing characters using indexing
  - Slicing strings (`string[start:end]`)
  - Common methods: `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`, `.find()`

- **Flowcharts**
  - Practiced turning logical steps into flowcharts
  - Used `pyflowchart` to convert Python code into visual flowcharts
    How to generate flowcharts:

Install pyflowchart library

Open vscode
In the terminal enter:
python3 -m pip install pyflowchart
If it says python3 is not recognised, try python without the number 3
Steps:
Open VSCode to the file you would like the flowchart of
In the terminal area type:
python3 -m pyflowchart your_file_name.py
Replace "your_file_name" with the name of the file you would like to generate a flowchart for
Press enter
Copy the generated code
Go to flowchart.js.org and paste the generated code
