Day 4 - Python Loops, Strings, and Operators
Welcome to Day 4 of my Python learning journey!
Today, I practiced core programming concepts including loops, nested loops, basic string operations, and Python operators.

🔁 Loops Practiced
✅ for Loops:
Looping through ranges with custom start, stop, and step values

Summing values inside a loop

Filtering even numbers

Iterating through strings by index

Nested loops to create number patterns and shapes

✅ while Loops:
Using condition-controlled loops with incremental updates

🔠 String Manipulation
Taking user input using input()

String slicing with custom steps (e.g., word[0:10:2])

Basic methods like .strip() and .replace()

Concatenating strings with variables

🔢 Operators Overview
Arithmetic Operators: +, -, \*, /, %, \*\*, //

Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, etc.

Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >=, <=

Bitwise / Logical Operators: and, or, not

🧠 Concepts Covered
Loop logic and control flow

Constructing patterns using nested loops

Working with string indices and methods

Understanding different types of operators

Introduction to the isinstance() function
