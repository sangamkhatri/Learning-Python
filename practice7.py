"""Letâ€™s create a small Python program that involves:

Lists

Dictionaries

Classes

File Input/Output (I/O)
 Mini Project Idea: Student Grade Tracker
We will:

Create a Student class.

Store multiple students in a list.

Use a dictionary to map student names to grades.

Read and write the student data to a file."""
