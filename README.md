# üêç Learning Python from Scratch

Hi! I'm Sangam ‚Äî and this is where I'm learning Python step by step from the basics.  
This repo includes beginner-friendly code, small exercises, and notes as I build my Python skills.

I'm focusing on:

- Variables, data types, and expressions
- String manipulation and logical thinking
- Python basics for IT and Data Science
- Practicing Git and GitHub alongside Python

I'm documenting everything here so that while I learn to code in the editor,  
I'm also learning how to use GitHub ‚Äî building good habits and version control skills along the way.
